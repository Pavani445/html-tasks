       Data Acquisition Unit is a mobile part of the Blue eyes system.  Its main task is to fetch the physiological data from the sensor and to send it to the central system to be processed. To accomplish the task the device must manage wireless Bluetooth connections (connection establishment, authentication and termination). Personal ID cards and PIN codes provide operator's authorization. Communication with  the  operator  is  carried  on  using  a  simple  5-key  keyboard,  a  small  LCD display  and a  beeper. When an exceptional situation is detected the device uses them to notify the operator.  Voice data is transferred using a small headset, interfaced to the DAU with standard mini-jack plugs.

        Central  System  Unit  hardware  is  the  second  peer  of  the  wireless connection. The box contains a Bluetooth module (based on ROK101008) and a PCM codec for voice data transmission. The module is interfaced to a PC using a parallel, serial and USB cable. The audio data is accessible through standard mini-jack sockets To  program  operator's  personal  ID  cards  we  developed  a  simple programming device. The programmer is interfaced to a PC using serial and PS/2 (power source) ports.  Inside, there is Atmel 89C2051 microcontroller, which handles UART transmission and I2C EEPROM (ID card) programming.

        Visualization module provides a user interface for the supervisors.  It  enables them  to   watch each of the working operator’s physiological condition along with a  preview  of  selected  video  source  and  related  sound  stream. All the incoming alarm messages are instantly signaled to the supervisor. The Visualization module can  be  set  in  an  offline mode, where  all  the  data  is  fetched  from  the  database. Watching all the recorded physiological parameters, alarms, video and audio data the supervisor is able to reconstruct the course of the selected operator’s duty.Visualization module provides a user interface for the supervisors.
